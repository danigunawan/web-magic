# face-api.js Demos

Some simple, straightforward demos for learning face-api.js and tensorflow.js with custom canvas drawing. These are some simple 'learning pages' that I like to create for myself and others and reduces complex demos into a 'Minimal Magical Product'.

While spending some time looking at tensorflow.js, I came across @justadudewhohacks wonderful face-api.js library.

This repo contains some progressively more complex, straightforward samples that I created for myself to learn face-api.js and running inference on webcam images for face detection and landmark to mesh generation.
